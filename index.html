    My site is plain on purpose.
    I believe in doing things with a purpose, keeping what matters and discarding the rest.
    Inspired by <a href="https://sivers.org">Derek Sivers's site</a>.

  	<h2>Me in 30 seconds</h2>
  	<p>
			I am a bioinformatician who loves creating <a href="#apps"> web applications</a>.
			Science is fun, but I like working on anything 
			that makes the user's lives easier.
		</p>
		<p>
			I do <strong>front-end</strong>, where you I communicate
			with the user thanks to the language of UX/UI.
			I value <strong>usability</strong>, <strong>stability</strong> and <strong>code maintainability</strong>, 
			specially for large applications.
		</p>
		<p>
			My code here is usually <strong>VanillaJS</strong> or <strong>ReactJS</strong>, 
			and I also have some experience with D3.js.
		</p>
		<p>
			I also have experience with <strong>back-end</strong>, where
			the heavy lifting is usually done.
			My preferred tools here 
			are <strong>Python</strong> (Django and Flask) 
			and <strong>Node</strong> (Express).
		</p>
		<p>
			Above all, I value learning. Experience and skill shouldn't be only measured
			in years but in the actions you take to continue learning. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Hey, but not everything is programming. I also enjoy reading books 
			and growing plants using the magic of Hydroponics. Space, travelling,
			philosophy, games, <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com">the why of things</a>,
			meditation, cats, minimalism or Japan are topics you can 
			use to get me to talk for a while.

			<h3>Gene Database</h3>
			<img className="app-img" src="img/database.png" />
			<p>
				While working on my Master's I developed a web application 
				to <strong>browse and analyze</strong> genes of a specific 
				family.
			</p>
			<p>
				The site includes a author-only section where the 
				lab members can <strong>update experiment results</strong>. 
				These results get parsed and <strong>integrated</strong> with 
				the rest of the data, then added to the browse section, 
				which includes <strong>filters</strong> to locate the right information.
			</p>
			<p>
				The entire back end is done with python cgi (no framework) and sqlite.
			</p>

			<h3>CharityMatch</h3>
			<a class="image featured">
				<img className="app-img" src="img/charitymatch.png" alt="" />
			</a>
			<p>
				My first hackathon experience. We brought our own challenge 
				to the hackathon: To create a site where you are matched 
				with a charity with the same <strong>values</strong> as you.
			</p>
			<p>
				I worked on the front end while my teammates did the back end 
				in Django. The site has a <strong>filter interface</strong> that 
				updates the matching sites in real time.

				<img className="app-img" src="img/globe.png" alt="The earth globe showing events as points of light" />
			</a>
			<p>
				My team and I created this site for the <a href="https://www.openhack.io">Malm√∂ 2017 Openhack</a>. 
				The <strong>challenge</strong>, proposed by the Ludwig Boltzmann Institute of Human Rights (BIM) in Vienna, was to create a site that showcased torture-awareness events around the world.
			</p>
			<p>
				We focused our day and a half in creating a <strong>stunning visualization</strong>, showing the events as nodes of light in a dark world. The biggest technical challenge was using three.js to create the 3D globe and learning about <strong>textures, meshes and shaders</strong>.
			</p>
			<p>
				We ended up winning the awards for best humanitarian impact and best speech :).
