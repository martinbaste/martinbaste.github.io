    My site is plain on purpose.
    I believe in keeping what matters and discarding the rest.
    Obviously inspired by <a href="https://sivers.org">Sivers's site</a>.

    <h2>Me in 30 seconds</h2>
    <p>
      I am a bioinformatician who loves creating <a href="#apps"> web applications</a>.
      Science is fun, but I like working on anything 
      that makes the user's lives easier.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do <strong>front-end</strong>, where you I communicate
      with the user thanks to the language of UX/UI.
      I value <strong>usability</strong>, <strong>stability</strong> and <strong>code maintainability</strong>, 
      specially for large applications.
    </p>
    <p>
      My code here is usually <strong>vanilla</strong> or <strong>ReactJS</strong>, 
      and I also have some experience with D3.js.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also deal with <strong>back-end</strong>, where
      the heavy lifting is usually done.
      My preferred tools here 
      are <strong>Python</strong> (Django and Flask) 
      and <strong>Node</strong> (Express).
    </p>
    <p>
      Above all, I value learning. Experience and skill shouldn't be only measured
      in years but in the actions you take to continue learning. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Hey, but not everything is programming. I also enjoy reading books 
      and growing plants using the magic of Hydroponics. Space, travelling,
      philosophy, games, <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com">the why of things</a>,
      meditation, cats, minimalism or Japan are topics you can 
      use to get me to talk for a while.

      <p>I've worked on some web applications over the years. The stacks used vary a lot, as I like to test new technologies and frameworks.</p>
      <p>Here are some of them. <a href="/tortureglobe">Torture Awareness Globe</a>, <a href="/gene-database">Gene Database</a> and <a href="/charitymatch">CharityMatch</a></p>
