My team and I created [this site](https://devpost.com/software/torture-awareness-globe) for the [Malm√∂ 2017 Openhack](https://www.openhack.io). 
The **challenge**, proposed by the Ludwig Boltzmann Institute of Human Rights (BIM) in Vienna, was to create a site that showcased torture-awareness events around the world.

We focused our day and a half in creating a **stunning visualization**, showing the events as nodes of light in a dark world. The biggest technical challenge was using three.js to create the 3D globe and learning about **textures, meshes and shaders**.

We ended up winning the awards for best humanitarian impact and best speech :).

Check out the [source code](https://github.com/LinkPact/OH2017Malmo) and try [the application](https://linkpact.github.io/OH2017Malmo/) (browser compatibility is far from perfect).
