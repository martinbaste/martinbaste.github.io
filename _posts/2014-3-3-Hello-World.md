title: Guessing a dinosaur's DNA
---

We had a lecture about phylogenetics today, and somehow we ended up talking about dinosaurs. Apparently the decay rate of the DNA makes it almost impossible for us to get a dinosaur's DNA from it's fossil. This is because by the time we try to recover the genetic material, it will most probably be non-existant. But it looks like proteins decay slower, so we can get the proteins sequenced and get a little insight on the mollecular appearance of the dinosaurs.
And it got me thinking. We can guess the DNA sequence for an amino acid sequence. We'll get a very large amount of valid DNA sequences. But what if we have multiple closely-related proteins? Can we make a better guess?
