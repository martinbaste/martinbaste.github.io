My first hackathon experience. We brought our own challenge to the hackathon: To create a site where you are matched with a charity with the same **values** as you.

I worked on the front end while my teammates did the back end in Django. The site has a **filter interface** that updates the matching sites in real time.

Check out the [source code](https://github.com/Johan37/OpenHack). Unfortunately the application is not deployed anywhere now.
