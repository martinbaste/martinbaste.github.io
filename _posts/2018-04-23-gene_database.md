While working on my Master's I developed a web application to **browse and analyze** genes of a specific 
family.

The site includes a author-only section where the lab members can **update experiment results**. These results get parsed and **integrated** with the rest of the data, then added to the browse section, which includes **filters** to locate the right information.

The entire back end is done with python cgi (no framework) and sqlite.
