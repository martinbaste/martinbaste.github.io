BRAVA (BrAPI Validator) is a web application where BrAPI developers can test their servers. [BrAPI](https://www.brapi.org) is an open API developed by plant breeders so they can transfer and access data online. 

To support this development I've worked on an application that tests a server and validates it's responses. The server that runs the tests is built in **Java**. The application has advanced features such as a **resource repository** and **scheduled tests**.

Check out the [**source code**](https://github.com/plantbreeding/IPK-BrAPI-Validator) and the [**live application**](http://webapps.ipk-gatersleben.de/brapivalidator).
